= Builder options

These control the methods available on, and the behaviour of, the generated `+Builder+` subclass. These are applied to the `+builderOptions = @BuilderOptions()+` sub setting like so:

.Placement example
[source,java]
----
@AdvancedRecordUtils(
    builderOptions = @BuilderOptions(
        // Options go here
    )
)
public record Person(String name, int age) {}
----

NOTE: The generated `+With+` and `+Mergable+` interfaces delegate all usage to the `+Builder+`, so all settings here impact those. In addition, the `+With+` interface creates some methods based on the methods being generated for the `+Builder+`.
