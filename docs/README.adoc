Advanced Record Utils is an annotation-processor based source code generator that creates a companion `+*Utils+` class (e.g., `+PersonUtils+` for a `+Person+` record) that contains:

* A "Builder" for the record
* A "With"er interface
* A "Merger" utility and interface
* An "XML" utility and interface for serialisation to XML
* A "Diff" interface and result class
* An "All" interface that bundles all the other interfaces together

It works recursively through a structure to create a "tree" of record, can import all records/interfaces in a package, or import specific records/interfaces from libraries or previously compiled modules.
