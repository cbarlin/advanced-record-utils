= `+@BeforeBuild+`

In the event you want to perform some operations on a builder before every build, you can use an `+@AdvancedRecordUtils.BeforeBuild+` annotation on a method.

CAUTION: `+@BeforeBuild+` runs on every build invocation. Keep work minimal, deterministic, and sideâ€‘effect free, otherwise you may degrade build performance or observe surprising behaviour.

This method must:

. be static
. return void
. have exactly one argument - the builder.

WARNING: The processor cannot validate whether you call `+build+` within the method, but doing so can lead to infinite recursion and a `+StackOverflowError+`.

The following is an example of how it can be used:

.SomeRecord.java
[source,java]
----
@AdvancedRecordUtils
public record SomeRecord (
    String a,
    String b
) {
    @AdvancedRecordUtils.BeforeBuild
    public static void fizzBuzz(SomeRecordUtils.Builder builder) {
        if ("fizz".equals(builder.a())) {
            builder.a("buzz");
        }
    }
}
